### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jeff Thomas and I enjoy programming in Python, Java, and JavaScript. I like to contribute to open source projects by helping troubleshoot user-reported issues on their issue tracker. A list of some of the issues I've previously helped can be found here: https://github.com/jeffthomasweb/GitHubIssuesHelped. Please feel free to reach out to me can at jeffthomasweb@gmail.com. I like to share what I've learned and I've presented at 3 Python meetups.  One of the presentations can be seen here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in7J6U0NQ7o.
