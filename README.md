### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jeff Thomas and I enjoy Java, Python and Golang programming. I like to contribute to open source projects by helping to troubleshoot probelms on their issue tracker. A list of some of the issues I've previously helped out on can be found here: https://github.com/jeffthomasweb/GitHubIssuesHelped. Please feel free to reach out to me can at jeffthomasweb@gmail.com. I like to share what I've learned and I've presented at 3 Python meetups.  One of the presentations can be seen here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in7J6U0NQ7o.
