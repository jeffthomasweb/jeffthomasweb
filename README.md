### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jeff Thomas and I enjoy Python, Java, and Golang programming. I help open source projects troubleshoot issues, a list of some of the issues I've previously helped out on can be found here: https://github.com/jeffthomasweb/GitHubIssuesHelped. I can be reached at jeffthomasweb@gmail.com. I've presented 3 Python meetup talks, one of the presentations can be seen here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in7J6U0NQ7o.
